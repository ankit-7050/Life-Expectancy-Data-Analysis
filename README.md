# Life-Expectancy-Data-Analysis
>> This project will analyze life expectancy data by looking at factors such as immunizations, mortality, finances, social factors, and other health-related issues.
>> It will make it easier for a country to identify the predicting factor contributing to a lower life expectancy value. 
>> This will also aid in recommending to a country which areas should be prioritized to effectively raise the population's life expectancy.
>> Power BI visualization types such as Pie Charts, Donut Charts, Line Charts, Treemap, Slicer, and Maps used for the overview page, while some different Charts are used for depicting country-wise data, etc.
